### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am LurchingDart

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on updating my readme.

Also, I am working on a few projects, you can check them out in my repositories.

The projects are:

- [**EncryptCaesar**](https://github.com/LurchingDart/EncryptCaesar) - A simple Caesar cipher encryption and decryption tool with some extra features.
- [**DataScouty**](https://github.com/LurchingDart/DataScouty) - A simple tool to scrape data from the courses platform of Platzi to make notes in Notion a lot easier.
<!--
**LurchingDart/LurchingDart** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
